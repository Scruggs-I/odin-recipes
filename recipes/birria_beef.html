                    <p><strong>Birria</strong> style beef is a wonderful recipe to make on a 
                    weekend day, when you have time to just let the 
                    beef braise slowly—good old low-and-slow—and 
                    fill your home with its deeply spiced, wonderfully 
                    heady aromas. Though you will need to set aside some 
                    time, you won't need to make any special grocery runs 
                    for the ingredients.</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                                <li>Cut open the dried chiles with kitchen scissors
                                or a knife and discard the seeds. Heat a large 
                                skillet over medium high heat. Toast the dried 
                                chiles for 4 minutes, moving them occasionally so
                                they don't burn, turn heat off.</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>Cover the chiles with 2 inches of water. Brin the
                                water to a boil over high heat. Once the water begins
                                to boil, turn the heat off and let the chilis soak until
                                softened, about 15 minutes.</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>Meanwhile, Preheat the oven to 350&#8457</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>Pat the beef dry with a paper towel and season the meat with salt and pepper.</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>In a large dutch oven heat the oil over medium high heat.
                                Working in batches, cook the meat on all sides until browned,
                                about 15-18 minutes total. Transfer the meat to a plate.</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>In the same pot, reduce the heat to medium and add the 
                                onion wedges. Cook until onions are browned on both sides, 
                                about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and toss until fragrant, about 
                                1-2 minutes. Add the cinnamon, oregano, cumin, bay leaves, 
                                and ginger to the pan, cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>   
                            <br>  
                                <li>Deglaze the pan by adding the beef stock and vinegar and scraping 
                                the bottom of the pan to loosen anything stuck to it. Remove the pot 
                                from the heat and allow ingredients to cool slightly.</li>  
                            <br>
                                <li>Add the contents of the pot to a blender along with the canned tomatoes.
                                Drain the softened chilis (discarding the water used for soaking) and add
                                them to the blender. Blend on high until fully combined and a smooth sauce
                                is achieved.</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>Add the beef along with the prepared chili sauce back to the dutch
                                oven, cover and cook on center rack until beef is tender and can be 
                                shredded with a fork, about 3-3.5 hours.</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>Remove the meat and shred it, discarding any large pieces of fat</li>
                            <br>
                                <li>Serve the meat along with the remaining broth/sauce in bowls garnished with
                                chopped onion and cilantro, in warm tortillas, as a filling for quesadillas.</li>
